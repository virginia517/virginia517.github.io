            <p>The elements of this page are relatedly close to each other. As you can notice, you can quickly read the information about this site. They don't clatter. You can find links about the site's company under the "About Maynilad" heading. If you have any questions about their services, you can click the links under the  Quick Links heading, and so on.</p>

            <h2>Repetition</h2>

            <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/ee7d1488-6273-4e1a-b6f7-eb2eef6a61d8%2Fcadbury-repetition.jpg?v=1600904062652"

            <p>This designer of this website applied the principle of repetition. As you can see, the navigation bar, search icon, and some paragraphs match the color of the text in the header. The colors of this page point to the product and create a sense of unity by using this repeatedly. All the buttons on this page have the same color. These also add organization to the design.</p>

            <h2>Hierarchy</h2>
            <p>Kitchen Warehouse</p>
            <a href="https://www.kitchenwarehouse.com.au/" target="_blank">kitchenwarehouse.com</a>
            <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/ee7d1488-6273-4e1a-b6f7-eb2eef6a61d8%2Fkitchenware-hierarchy.jpg?v=1600904890845"
                alt="Kitchen Warehouse Image">
            <p>The first thing that caught my eyes when the first time I saw this was the red 20% off in the middle of the image; second, the text with the red background on the top of the page; and third was the search icon with the red background. The three elements with the same color with different sizes exemplify the principle of Hierarchy. This site tells the reader that they have 20 percent sale and then invites them to shop at their store or search for their product. The most important message is the largest element with the color red.</p>
